## 🏗️ Data Architecture  

The solution follows the **Medallion Architecture** with three layers:  

![Data Architecture]

1. **Bronze (Raw Layer)** → Stores ingested data from CSV files into SQL Server (ERP & CRM sources).  
2. **Silver (Cleansed Layer)** → Standardizes, validates, and transforms raw data into a structured form.  
3. **Gold (Analytics Layer)** → Provides **business-ready, star-schema models** optimized for reporting.
